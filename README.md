# Sorting-Algorithms
Implementation for the following sort operations. a. Bubble sort b. Insertion sort c. Merge-sort d. Quicksort e. Heap-sort f. Counting sort g. Radix-sort


Objective:
The objective of this homework is to investigate different sorting algorithms.
Scenario:
In this assignment, we are going to be investigating the actual performance of different sorting
methods. Additionally, we will implement 1 sorting method on a linked list. This needs to
be written using C++.

Requirements:
1. Create a program that generate an array of sizes n= 10, 100, 500, 5000 and 25000 items.
Your program should populate those arrays with randomly generated integers with a value
between 0 and the 2n where n is the size of the array. Create an implementation for the
following sort operations.
a. Bubble sort
b. Insertion sort
c. Merge-sort
d. Quicksort
e. Heap-sort
f. Counting sort
g. Radix-sort

3. Test each of the sort operations and record the time the sort takes to complete. You should
test each on the same unsorted array to get the best comparison. You should do this for
each array size (from requirement 1) a minimum of 10 times. Your test should use the
chrono libraryâ€™s high_resolution_clock class. The following example of how to do this in
nanoseconds is found on Stack Overflow. Only the time in the 7 sort functions should be
measured.

1. #include <iostream> 
2. #include <chrono>
3. typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock Clock;
4. int main()
6. {
7. auto t1 = Clock::now();
8. auto t2 = Clock::now();
9. std::cout << "Delta t2-t1: "
10. << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>(t2 - t1).count()
11. << " nanoseconds" << std::endl;
12. }

If any 1 test run takes longer than 5 minutes, you may discontinue that test and record that
the time took longer than 5 minutes. Likewise, should any test crash due to running out of
memory, record that as well. Graph this data and explain how well or poorly it matches
your expectations for performance given the known Big O notation for the given sort
algorithms. Include what you expected for time for each of the array sizes based on the
results for array size of 10.

3. Create a linked list class that can store Student information. The Student information must
include First Name, Last Name, MNumber and may include any other additional
information you wish. In addition to any required members to make the linked list work,
include 3 of the above sort algorithms to support sorting by First Name, Last Name and
MNumber (each algorithm sorts by 1 of the 3) and includes a parameter for ascending or
descending. Seed your linked list with data for 50 students that will result in a different
order for each of the fields. Include a menu interface that allows the user to select the sort
method and direction and will display the sorted students on the screen.
